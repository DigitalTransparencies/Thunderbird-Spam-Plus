# Thunderbird-Spam-Plus
An addon based on friedPotat0/Spam-Scores
# Spam+ (Thunderbird Add-on)

Spam+ is an add-on for Thunderbird (Version 78.0a1 - \*). If you can't configure the server host with DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL), Realtime Blackhole Lists (RBL), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF). This is a workaround where we make a free community like list and rules.

Since Thunderbird's "Customize..." Filters sometimes do work and sometimes doesn't work with we'll just compile it in this add-on.
